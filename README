This is the code repository for the project 'Generative prediction of causal gene sets responsible for complex traits'. 

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and a python script.


Data: 1) single-cell RNAseq data on the human complex disease traits featured in the manuscript (labeled by GEO series, see Table 1 in main text).
      2) transcriptional responses to gene perturbations.
      3) gene_dict and matching_indices needed to run the jupyter notebooks below.
      4) sample optimization data for allergic asthma trait to run the second jupyter notebook TWAVE2 below: data_aa_lam_3.zip.
      Data sourses were too alrge to upload to github and can be found on the following google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_H66cbaQ5b0b8PE_XHILDVhLP8XNjaj3?usp=sharing

Jupyter notebooks: 1) TWAVE1: a notebook implementing the variational autoencoder TWAVE, as well as dimensionality reduction via selection of causal eigengenes
                   2) TWAVE2: a notebook implementing post-optimization analysis by the maximum entropy graph null model and construction of gene perturbation co-occurrence networks.

Python script: TWAVE_optimization: implementing constrained optimization to find relevant genes that drive the transition between baseline and variant clusters in causal eigengene space.
               Likley needs to be run on the cluster (2500 X 2 optimizations each taking ~15-30 minutes).
